# CybersecurityAttack_KDD-

Network security is becoming increasingly important because of the massive expansion of computer networks' usage and the number of applications built on top of them, while all systems experience security flaws that could lead to an increase in attacks that could have a negative impact on the economy. Therefore, detecting vulnerabilities in the system in the network has become more important and needs to be done as accurately as possible in real-time.


A model must be created and trained using the Machine Learning classifier to distinguish if there is an attack in the network packet or not.

Here are the goals of this exploration:

* 1-Gaining a basic understanding of the data set
* 2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
* 3-Being able to classify if the packets are attack or normal
* 4- Walk through some fundamental concepts of building machine learning models
* 5- We apply machine learning algorithms 
 * *-Logistic Regression
 * *-GaussianNB
 * *-Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
 * *-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
 * *-K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)with Bee
 * *-LSTM
 * *-CNN
 * *-ANN-1
 * *-ANN-2
 * *-RNN
 * *-GRU

* 6- To evaluate the performance or quality of the model, different performances such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, MCC, AUC, and confusion matrix
